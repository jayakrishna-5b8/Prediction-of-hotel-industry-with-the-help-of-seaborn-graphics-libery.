# Problem Statement
The organization has been provided “Tips.csv” data set including 
various including various columns such as total bins,tip 
amount,gender,person per give and days of the week.As a data science 
engineer my task is predict and analysis data set using cborn 
visualizaation library and generate insides and explore the reduction 
between different columns according to the needs.
Task1: Plot the trands between columns total_bins across tip. 
TASK2: Find out which day tatal bin has a max or min , along with that 
no of customers. 
Task3: Predict which day no of customers rate should be high. 
Task4: Plot al the columns in a single plot. 
Task5: Find out reduction between different diff columns. 
Task6: Find out huminitive frequency on the basis of feature of total 
amount. 
Task7: Find out how many customers has give high no of rupees on 
particular day. 
Task8: Use the statatics and find out which column contains max 
outliers(error). 
Task9: Visualize tip across total bill in such a way outliers and range 
show in a single plot. 
Task10: Visualize total bill seperately for each particualr day.

19. # Conclusion
1.The trends between total bill vs tip as shown scatter plot,which show maximum tip has a 10
rupees or amount 50 rupees.

2.The maximum total bills 21 rupees on sunday and minimum 17 rupees on friday


3.Saturday has height number of customers visited to the hotel.The average count is 85.


4.All the columns are visualize in pair plot.


5.The relationship between different kinds of columns as shown in heatmap such as total bill and
tip , tip and size etc…,


6.The cummulative frequency as found 61 related to total amount.


7.According to Violin plot in sunday height among this 25, Saturday = 28 rupees , Thursday =20
rupees , Friday = 22 rupees.


8.Size column as contains maximum number of outliers
